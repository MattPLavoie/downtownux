    <p>
      DUX Day is an all day mini-conference. The theme is mastering prototyping tools, and together we will do just that. Learn from experts in the community as they show you what you can do with a plethora of prototyping tools. Speakers will be highlighting Invision, Axure and Framer.

      <span title="Attendees will get more details about the prototyping tools and how to download free trial versions closer to the event.">Bring your laptop loaded with these tools<sup class=""><i class="fa fa-question"></i></sup></span>, because the afternoon will include workshops. Decide which tool you want to dive in with, and get hands on experience in a small class format creating prototypes with the pros.
